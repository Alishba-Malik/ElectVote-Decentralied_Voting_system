# Decentralized voting system on Ethereum Sepolia with The Graph subgraphs
ElectVote is a decentralized voting application built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. The system uses smart contracts to enforce voting rules, store results immutably, and eliminate the risks associated with centralized voting platforms.

The application integrates Solidity smart contracts, a React (Vite) frontend, MetaMask wallet authentication, and ethers.js for blockchain communication. All votes, candidates, and election states are stored directly on-chain, ensuring complete auditability and preventing any unauthorized modification.

**Key Features:**

Blockchain-based vote recording for immutability and transparency

One wallet, one vote validation to prevent duplicate voting

Admin-controlled election management (add/delete candidates, set/ reset voting windows)

Time-bound voting window enforced directly by the smart contract

Live leaderboard displaying real-time vote counts on-chain

Pause/Unpause election mechanism for emergency control

MetaMask authentication for secure transaction signing

Contract fully deployed and verified on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet


ElectVote demonstrates how decentralized technologies can be used to build trustless, secure, and verifiable digital election systems without relying on centralized servers or databases.
